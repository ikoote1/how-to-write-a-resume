Writing a resume header
Your header should be no more than 1/6th of the page
An overlong header wastes space that could otherwise be used to showcase your accomplishments, and can signal to hiring managers that you're trying to take up space. Keep your header to no more than 1/6th of the page (or about 2 inches).

Include must-have information
Headers are somewhat customizable, but there are a few things you must include in your header, things you can include, things you should not include except in specific circumstances, and things you must not ever include.

You must include:

Your full name. You may use a preferred name instead of your legal first name.
Your desired job title (such as "Full-Stack Developer").
Your professional email address.
A link to your portfolio.
A link to your GitHub profile.
A link to your LinkedIn profile.
You can include (if you have room):

Your phone number. Please include your country code.
Your address (only city, state, and/or country, not the street name/house number)
A link to your Wellfound profile.
A link to your professional Twitter profile.
A link to Medium or any other site where you share development-related writing.
You should not include (except in specific circumstances):

A photo, unless you're applying to a job in a country/culture where photos are required.
Your nationality, unless you're applying to a job that requires you to have specific citizenship.
You should never include:

Your age or date of birth
Your gender or orientation
Your ethnicity
Your previous salary information
